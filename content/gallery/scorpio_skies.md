Taken at Joshua Tree National Park in October 2022. The foreground shows a rock formation near the "Hall of Horrors" area of the park. When taking photos like this, you always need to figure out how (or if) you will illuminate the foreground, since there is usually no natural illumination available. The lights we brought with us were too small to do what we wanted, so we waited for a car of a fellow traveler to pass by on the nearby road. It's tail lights provided a nice red tint for the rock formations.
